            <p class="des">Android offers a variety of ways to present content to a user. To provide a user experience that’s consistent with the rest of the platform, it’s usually best to build a native app that incorporates framework-provided lessons, such as Android Apps Links or Searches. Additionally, you can use Google Play-based experiences, such as App Actions and Slices, where Google Play services are available. Some apps, however, may need increased control over the UI. In this case, a WebView is a good option for displaying trusted first-party content.</p>

                <p class="title">iOS Development</p>
                <p class="des">Apps need to work with the iOS to ensure that they deliver a great user experience. Beyond just a good design for your app’s design and user interface, a great user experience encompasses many other factors. Users expect iOS apps to be fast and responsive while hoping the app to use as little power as possible. Apps need to support all of the latest iOS devices while still appearing as if the app was tailored for the current invention. Implementing all of these behaviours can seem daunting at first, but iOS provides the help you need to make it happen.</p>

                    <p class="title">App Development</p>
                    <p class="des">Objective-C is a high-level programming language based on C, with additional features and syntax from Smalltalk. It is a superset of the C language, which means that any valid C code will run in an Objective-C compiler. This was an intentional decision made by the designers of the word, who wanted to make sure that the language was backwards-compatible with existing C applications and components since that language was used for the majority of operating system and utilities programming up to that point.</p>

                        <p class="des">Kotlin is fully compatible with JDK 6, ensuring that Kotlin applications can run on older Android devices with no issues. The Kotlin tooling is fully supported in Android Studio and consistent with the Android build system.
A Kotlin application runs as fast as an equivalent Java one, thanks to a very similar bytecode structure. With Kotlin's support for inline functions, code using lambdas often runs even faster than the same system written in Java.</p>

                            <p class="des">Swift is a fantastic way to write software, whether it’s for phones, desktops, servers, or anything else that runs the code. It’s a safe, fast, and interactive programming language that combines the best in modern language thinking with wisdom from the broader Apple engineering culture and the diverse contributions from its open-source community. The compiler is optimised for performance, and the word is maximised for development, without compromising on either.</p>
