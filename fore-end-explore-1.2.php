            <p class="title">PEOPLE DONT BUY FEATURES; THEY BUY EXPERIENCE</p>
            <p class="des">WordPress CMS adds a user-friendly administrative area to your website allowing you to quickly login and update the content of your website at any time. You can effortlessly make textual, graphics or structural changes to the website in an instant without having to deal with or look at any of the complicated programming code. You will have full control over your website’s content.</p>

                <p class="heading">Custom Theme</p>
                <p class="title">WordPress themes which have been coded from scratch</p>
                <p class="des">Custom WordPress theme creation begins with creating a unique design. This process starts with a pen and paper to sketch page layouts, wireframes, sitemaps and menu structures. Digital models are then built using the sketches, and your company’s brand guidelines are added for a personalised look and feel. You will be presented with a variety of website design concepts to review.</p>

                    <p class="heading">Pre-Purchased Themes</p>
                    <p class="title">A pre-purchased WordPress theme is perfect for websites on a tight budget or deadline.</p>
                    <p class="des">It is an out-of-the-box design and layout that is ready to integrate into the WordPress CMS straight away. WordPress handles all of the content for you (posts, pages, comments etc.), while the theme transforms that content into a beautiful and clean layout for your audience to view. You will be able to make minor changes to the design to incorporate your company branding such as changing colours, adding a logo and adding imagery but if you are looking for a unique, custom design, you should opt for a custom WordPress theme.</p>
