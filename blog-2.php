                    <p class="des">In a world where having a website presence wasn’t a big thing, now it’s essential. That same technology take-over we are now seeing applied to mobile apps. SME’s are reporting back two or 3 times the increase of revenue when adopting the latest mobile app technology. Today it’s rare to catch someone who doesn’t own a smartphone, and survival without a dedicated mobile app doesn’t make sense if you’re planning on taking your company and marketing to the next level.</p>

                    <p class="des">Apps serve many functions, and a typical customer will spend 86% more time on a business’s app than they would be compared to visiting a site on a browser. To pinpoint exactly why is difficult, but it’s generally accepted that it’s appealing to tech-savvy users. They have all the information they need at their fingertips.</p>

With mobile apps, companies can communicate and target these users with ease and while being less intrusive than traditional marketing, and more importantly, they can do that while improving the customer's experience!</p>

                    <p class="des">We live in a fast-paced world. A world that moves so fast that sometimes even typing in an address (especially on a smartphone) can be deemed too long of a task and the customer won’t bother. An app massively reduces your customers’ efforts and achieves what you and they want out of the experience.</p>

                    <p class="des">A well designed and coded app will outperform a website, by quite a bit. This encourages the user to do more and stay longer. As we all know there’s nothing more frustrating than a slow browsing experience.</p>
