                    <p class="des">If you have heard terms like Ruby on Rails or Rails programming, then you’re only a little behind with the hottest trend that has taken the web development industry by a storm. But what exactly is Ruby on Rails? Ruby Rails or Ruby on Rails is an open source web application framework that is, of course, written in Ruby (a programming language). Rails is a software library that extends or simply a software code that is added to the Ruby Programming language. Here are 5 reasons why Ruby on Rails can be a good option for web development.</p>

                    <div>
                    <p class="heading">Launch Quicker:</p>
                    <p class="title">FAST EXECUTION TIME</p>
                    <p class="des">Ruby uses a vast set of ready to use modules & solutions in Ruby on Rails programming software library. These tools, because they are prepared to handle, can save up to 30% on development time and therefore resulting in a quicker launch.</p>

                    <div>
                    <p class="heading">Cost-Effective:</p>
                    <p class="title">RUBY TENDS TO SAVE DEVELOPMENT COST</p>
                    <p class="des">Ruby also tends to save a lot of money on development cost. This is due to the development time being quicker. The quicker the developers can develop your software; the less time you’re paying for them to work.</p>
                    </div><br/><br/>

                    <div>

                    <p class="title">IT SAVES DEVELOPER VALUEABLE TIME</p>
                    <p class="des">Ruby is unique in the sense that they have a built-in test system and thus manual testing isn’t necessary. It’s test-driven development methodology ensures that the code will only exist after they have been intensively tested, this allows the developer to save a lot of time and a lot of your money.</p>

                    <p class="des">ROR is easily readable, and this allows other ROR developers to step in and update a project efficiently. This flexibility is desirable with clients as everyone loves options.</p>

                    <p class="des">ROR has so many ready to use solutions, built-in tools, etc. What that is makes is an excellent language to build sophisticated websites with. Also, because it is an open source framework, it is even easier to find solutions to the most complex issues that arise in the development stage. <br/><br/>There are a few huge companies out there using Ruby on Rails, such as Twitter and Sound Cloud. They demonstrate that the sky is the limit with this programming language and it is a force to be reckoned with.</p>
